    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Your team has just arrived at WWI (a leading company in logitics). Welcome!   <br>\n",
    "Even though business is striving, the IT department is going through a bad time.   <br>\n",
    "Digitalization was never a priority for the company and now the company operational and analytical requirements is starting to grow beyond the capabilities of their existing data architecture.   <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "WWI data is spread accross different systems. Namely, an old SQL database, data extracted through an API, and data stored in CSV files. <br>\n",
    "Currently, the costs to develop the necessary queries to collect data to answer questions asked by the different departments are too high. <br>\n",
    "Management concluded it is the right time to revise and revamp the data architecture, in order to speed up operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In that context, your team was tasked with merging all the company data into a single and coherent Mongo database. <br>\n",
    "It is expected that, with your solution, WWI will have a better understanding of their business and that the different departments will be able to obtain efficiently the answers they desperatly need.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WWI team shared with you an ERD of their current datamodel:<br>\n",
    "![datamodel](WWI.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Addtionally, the WWI team asked you the deliver the following outputs in **10 days**:\n",
    "- Understand and model the database.  \n",
    "- Migrate all data to the database\n",
    "- Answer the questions.  \n",
    "- Submit the results by following the instructions.  \n",
    "- Prepare a short oral presentation to explain your design choices and the results you obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these deliveries, you will have created a prototype and allows the management to decide whether MongoDB is a good solution that meets their requirements.\n",

    "\n",
    "You have been informed that the WWI has the following query requirements to the database.\n",

    "- From which state province are our suppliers from?   \n",
    "- From which state province are the customers who have a higher credit limit?  \n",

    "\n",
    "The warehouse group needs:  \n",
    "- To know which items get ordered together the most?   \n",
    "- Which items get ordered the most in bulk (bigger amounts)?  \n",
    "- Which customers have delivery addresses under 10km of distance?  \n",
    "\n",
    "The CFO:  \n",
    "- Would like to know the monthly order count?  \n",
    "- Would like to know the average monthly sales prices?  \n",
    "- Would like to know the yearly expenditures with suppliers (per supplier name)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Partnerships:  \n",
    "- Would like to know what's the most common payment type?  \n",
    "- Which supplier of `Novelty Goods Supplier` as the most transactions?  \n",
    "\n",
    "The marketing team:  \n",
    "- Want to make an appreciation post and needs the name of the sales person with the most invoices in 2013 (person who's customers brought the most money)?\n",
